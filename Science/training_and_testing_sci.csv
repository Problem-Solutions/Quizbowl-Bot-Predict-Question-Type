"['When these objects have low viscosity and have cooling advection currents, they are called ""Polish doughnuts."" Balbus and Hawley studied their magnetorotational instability. The interior of these objects contain x-ray emissions from quasi-periodic oscillations. A explanation of the Newtonian physics in these objects was given by Shapiro and Teukolsky, and a Blandford-Znajek process can take place in the presence of one of these objects. A model to measure the viscosity in these objects was proposed by Shakura and Sunyaev, and it\'s possible for these objects to have luminosities over ten times the Eddington limit. A system with one of these objects gets rid of angular momentum and not mass by means of jets emitted perpendicular to these objects. FTP, identify this structures which form from the compression of material built up around a star.']",['accretion disks']
"['RPN1 and RPN2 code for an integral protein within this structure. One type of this structure contains glucose-6-phosphatase and stores and pumps calcium ions. Vesicles coated with COP I are targeted to return to this organelle, while those with COP II leave it. One type metabolizes glycogen and synthesizes steroids, while another type synthesizes secreted proteins. Its lumen is contiguous with the perinuclear space, and the two different types of this organelle synthesize lipids and proteins. For 10 points, name this organelle in which the presence of bound ribosomes differentiates the ""rough"" and ""smooth"" types.']",['endoplasmic reticulum ']
"['One class of compounds with this therapeutic activity have two benzene rings fused to a cyclo-heptene- ylid-ene ring or a dihydro-azepine ring as a skeletal structure. In addition to those tricyclic compounds, this therapeutic activity may be present in hypericin and hyperforin. The efficacy of drugs with this therapeutic activity is measured using the Porsolt test. A non-traditional example of drugs with this activity includes agomelatine, in which melatonin\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s indole skeleton is replaced with naphthalene. One class of drugs with this activity insert into the extracellular Y176 and F335 residues of SERT. The earliest drugs with this activity were discovered because of their ability to inhibit the oxidation of tyramine, and examples of those drugs include tranyl-cypramine and iso-carboxazid. Those compounds with this activity inhibit the oxidation of monoamines. For 10 points, name these drugs that usually effect an increase in concentrations of neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine.']",['antidepressants ']
"['This entity contains the brightest globular cluster in the local group, known as Mayall II, and appears to have a double nucleus. Its interactions with neighboring galaxies such as the Triangulum appear to have warped its disk. It is the largest member of the (*) Local Group, and is predicted to collide with the Milky Way in 3 to 5 billion years. M31 is the Messier classification of, for 10 points, what closest spiral galaxy to us?']",['Andromeda']
