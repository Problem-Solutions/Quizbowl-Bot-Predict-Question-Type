"(JG) The single lit candle among the brass chandelier's several has resulted in widely-varying interpre- tations, but the most common is that it represents the titular event. Indeed, it is often argued that the paint- ing was created as a legal document to validate that. However, this is called into question by the left fig- ure's use of his left hand instead of his right. The woman looks pregnant, but this was probably simply due to the predominant style of 1434, when it was made. A dog sits at her feet, and an observer of the ceremony can be seen in the mirror.

"(JG) Physicist David Stork criticized this theory on the grounds that the visual evidence is inconsistent with the theory's basic statement. It was first posited in the journal Optics and Photonics, and another strike against it is that there are no records of the necessary equipment existing. An ear in a portrait of Cardinal Albergati and the chandelier in another van Eyck work were two of the original examples cited in the paper, which was inspired by its author's visit to the National Gallery.

"During the Hellenistic period, the millefiori technique was developed, allowing people to create intricate designs in it. A light green type of this, called trinitite, was formed as a result of the Trinity nuclear test. It is formed by quenching a melt. In medieval Europe, the bullseye of the crown type of this was less expensive than the outer edges. Because of the lack of electric transition states in the range of visible light and because of its homogeneity, it is usually transparent.

When it was first performed, it was the last of four movements, the other three of which were later published as Scenes historiques. For a while, it had to be performed under the title Impromptu due to Russian rule, but the name by which it goes today was first suggested by Axel Carpelan, a fan of this work.
